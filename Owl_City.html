    <p>
      Owl City is an American electronic music project created in 2007 in 
      Owatonna, Minnesota; it is one of several projects by singer, songwriter 
      and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young. Young created the project while experimenting 
      with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the 
      social networking site MySpace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, 
      before signing with Universal Republic Records, now Republic Records, in 2008.
